Let it be known that the version of raphael.js that we are using is a customized version that I wrote
 (I being Mika Sanchez).
 
 There are a few things that have been added. The source code for the project including the 
 explanation of what the functions do can be found in the raphael.core.js.
 
 We are also using the new version of the eve.js library (v0.4.1). Looking at the source code you 
 should be able to figure out any questions you might have about how things work.
